## Overview
A genius alchemist who is mostly solitary. Has connections with the [[Book Club and Coven]] but only joins the actual book club meetings when they have something magic related to discuss with [[Dorothea Hawthorne]] or [[Heath M. Laffee]]. A bit serious to a fault. 

### Touch
Their touch gives them random, sudden flashes of inspiration. Unprecedented mental acuity and access to information they had no way of knowing. Has occurred in tests and exams, which they then usually ace. Thinks it's their fault they can't perform at 100% of inspiration flash.
