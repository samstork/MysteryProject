This is the home of all the notes for the planning and running of the Mystery Project we're planning for Cass' birthday party. 

## Use
1. Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) 
2. Make sure you're a collaborator on this repository, if not, contact me about it
3. Pull this repository using Git
	- If you have never done this before: 
	- install git on your computer. There's a [GUI desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/download/) if you don't want to deal with command line stuff. It will also guide you through the installation process. I will assume that if you're unfamiliar with git you're using this app.
	- Once you open the app and log in, you should see a drop-down menu for repositories in the top left. Select this one.
	- Click Fetch origin and then Pull origin. It's 2 tabs over from the drop-down
4. Launch obsidian
5. Click "open folder as vault" and choose the folder this file is in, wherever you put it on your device
6. Click "trust author". If you trust me. I'm the author. 
7. Edit any settings as you see fit
8. Once you've made any edits you want to make, go back to git and push the edits. No need to branch or anything, just commit straight to main unless there are conflicts.
	- If you haven't done this before:
	- Give a summary for the edits you made, and if you want a longer description. For most things, don't bother. 
	- Click commit to main. If there are conflicts, despair.
	- Click push. It's in the same spot as Fetch origin and Pull origin.

Make sure to go to pull the repository regularly so you get the most up-to-date version of the notes. 

## Where to Start
We've made a start on setting everything up. On 2025-03-09 #Alissa, #Rachelle, and #Sam met up with #Jana joining online for a bit. We did a [[Brainstorming Session Rough Notes (2025-03-09)|Brainstorming Session]], and the product of what we have now is all written in the [[Primer]]. So to get caught up, just read that.

I, #Sam, have been adding some characters and groups. Feel free to browse the wiki. If you're on obsidian, press ctrl/cmd + g to view the graph view.
