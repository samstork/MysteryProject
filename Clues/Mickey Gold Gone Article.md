**Where is Mickey?**

Mickey Gold (nee Phil Chesterfield), singer and guitarist of the band *The Goodyes*, has not been seen since the evening of **November 17th**, when he performed with bandmate **Courtney Wilson** at the popular venue **Pollock**.

Witnesses report that Gold left the venue alone after the show, after an extended afterparty. "It was a little weird," one of the other attendees who has chosen to remain anonymous told us, "He doesn't usually leave the party alone."

Close friends and family have expressed growing concern. “This isn’t like him,” said Wilson, who describes their last interaction as “tense, but not final.” Former bandmate L.V. Baker has joined the search efforts, reportedly scouring fan forums and local leads.

Known for his magnetic stage presence and charisma, Gold helped _The Goodbyes_ rise to local fame with only a handful intimate shows.

Anyone with information is encouraged to contact local authorities or submit anonymous tips to the band's official instagram.
