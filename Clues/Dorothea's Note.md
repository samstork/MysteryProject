Dear Cassandra,

You're the only person I can contact right now for some reason. I'm just glad I managed to reach someone. I'm sorry to have to do this on your birthday, but I really need your help. I have to make this quick.

Someone has been magically trapping people. Yes magic is real, moving on. I think I know why, each of them has some kind of fae touch. There's more information about that in my book if you can decipher it. 

They have forgotten who they are, you have to remind them. Names, facts, relationships. And, while most won't know of their own touch, you must find out what their touch is. That is the only way to break the curse they're under. 

Once enough of the curse has been broken, they're set free. There may be more pendants out there, you don't have to break every single curse to free them all. 

Also, you might be able to talk to them, which might help. They probably won't remember much, but it might be helpful somehow. 

I've attached as much evidence as I could. Images, videos, and recordings didn't transfer right, I'm sorry about that. There's more evidence hidden in the place I crossed over. I'm sure you can find it.  

Yours Kindly, 
Dorothea Hawthorne.
