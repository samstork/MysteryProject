- About lucy:
A: "I'm telling you, she should join my fencing team."
R: "you always say that"
A: "She has the build for it."
R: "that's rude"
A: "What? Me? Rude? No! Never! maybe... It's true though. Small frame, long arms, she'd be great."
A: "Was it actually rude?"
R: "A little"
A: "I meant it as a compliment"
R: "I'll let her know when I tell her"
A: "WHAT? NO! STop!"
R: "See, if you react like that to me telling her directly, that means it's rude"

A: "Hey, I think I know someone who might want to join."
R: "Who's that?"
A: "Friend of mine. She's always wanted to try D&D, but never got the chance." *edited*

A: "Just one. Gnome barbarian named Gnorton."
R: "*sigh*, I'll *allow* it"
A: "Big mistake."
A: "I know you're smiling."
R: "Shut up"

A: "It's very tragic."
R: "Wouldn't expect anything less"

A: "Hey, sorry to ask this, but..."
A: "Would it be possible to do the session somewhere else next time?"
A: "I could barely focus because of all the sneezing."
A: "IDK I usually don't react *that* badly to [[Mrs. Crimes|Mrs. Crimes]]"
R: "Yeah! Totally! Would you be up for hosting or should I ask Chloe?"
A: "I can definitely host. Thank you"
R: "Absolutely. Don't stress it. I'm sorry about the cat, I tried to keep her away"

R: "Hey I just wanted to check in with you. You seemed like you were having a really tough time in the session today, I just wanted to see if everything's alright"
A: "Yeah, It's all good."
R: "If you need something, you know I'm here for you, right?"

A: "Hey Mona, thanks for the session!"
A: "Do we level up?"
R: "No"
A: "Wishful thinking"
R: "Anyways... How was it today? With Mrs. Crimes? You seemed to be doing fine"
A: "Yeah, weirdly enough, Mrs. Crimes was innocent today. I felt fine."
R: "Huh. Weird."
A: "That's what I'm saying!"

R: "Wanna go see Vince's band, they're doing a gig tomorrow"
A: "I thought he left the Goodbyes."
R: "Right..."
A: "Wanna go anyway?"
R: "Hahaha, for sure"
A: "Mind if I invite Chloe?"
R: "Go for it! I know she likes them"

R: "Is something happening between you and Chloe"
A: "WDYM?"
R: "You know what I mean"
A: "No"
A: "I don't think so."
A: "Why are you asking me this?"
R: "Just curious"
A: "I don't know."
R: "Is it cause she's..."
A: "No, definitely not"
R: "Hey, there's nothing wrong with having a preference, even if I can't exactly relate"
A: "And yeah, she's cute, but Idk if we're like that."
R: "I'll wingman you"
A: "What"
R: "It's decided."
