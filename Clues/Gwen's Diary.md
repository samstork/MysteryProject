Dear Mum,
I've arrived well in Groningen. The town is much smaller rustic than I thought it would be, but it still seems fun. I'm really excited to see who I meet, and experiences I'll have. I'm looking forward to finally living on my own for a bit. 

Dear Mum,
I've been stuck inside for a while now. The pandemic really hit us hard. At least I've made some friends. I know we're not supposed to meet, but I can't keep rotting away alone at home. It's not any sort of big gathering. We're just just hanging out and chilling. 

Dear Mum, 
I might've gone overboard a bit last time. My head feels fuzzy all the time, and I keep seeing things out of the corner of my eye. It's already been a couple of days. The come-down isn't usually this bad. I'm a bit worried, honestly. My memory of the trip is really hazy, but I think it's slowly coming back to me. It was a full on out of body experience. It's really weird, I actually took less than usual. 

Dear Mum, 
The lockdown's mostly lifted. It's really nice to finally get to go outside again. I found this really cosy little coffee shop (the beverage kind, not the weed kind), it's absolutely adorable. It's filled to the brim with books. Calling it a library wouldn't be far off. 
On another note, my trip's fully come back to me. It feels so real, and yet so much like a dream at once. I met this fairy king called Carmanos, and spent several days in his court before returning during the same night I left. I know it sounds like something straight out of romantasy, but I haven't been reading any of that! I swear! Besides, it was all SFW. 

Dear Mum, 
I've grown close to the woman who runs the Coffee Nook. She doesn't talk much, and is very strict with little things sometimes. Actually kind of rude and a bit of a Karen before you get to know her. She reminds me of you, in a lot of ways. But that's a good thing, actually. I miss you, mum. 

Dear Mum, 
There's a little book club that meets at the Coffee Nook. It's only four people, so I feel a bit weird listening in on their conversations, but you know I can't really help myself. Apparently one of the members knows Casey, so she lets them get away with a lot more than other customers. She really doesn't like one of the people there, and I think she's got bad blood with one of the others. I have to disagree though, as far as I can tell everyone there is delightful!
