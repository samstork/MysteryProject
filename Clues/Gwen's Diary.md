Dear Mum,
I've arrived well in Groningen. The town is much smaller rustic than I thought it would be, but it still seems fun. I'm really excited to see who I meet, and experiences I'll have. I'm looking forward to finally living on my own for a bit. 

Dear Mum,
I've been stuck inside for a while now. The pandemic really hit us hard. At least I've made some friends. I know we're not supposed to meet, but I can't keep rotting away alone at home. It's not any sort of big gathering. We're just just hanging out and chilling. 

Dear Mum, 
I might've gone overboard a bit last time. My head feels fuzzy all the time, and I keep seeing things out of the corner of my eye. It's already been a couple of days. The come-down isn't usually this bad. I'm a bit worried, honestly. My memory of the trip is really hazy, but I think it's slowly coming back to me. It was a full on out of body experience. It's really weird, I actually took less than usual. 

Dear Mum, 
The lockdown's mostly lifted. It's really nice to finally get to go outside again. I found this really cosy little coffee shop (the beverage kind, not the weed kind), it's absolutely adorable. It's filled to the brim with books. Calling it a library wouldn't be far off. 
On another note, my trip's fully come back to me. It feels so real, and yet so much like a dream at once. I met this fairy king called Carmanos, and spent several days in his court before returning during the same night I left. I know it sounds like something straight out of romantasy, but I haven't been reading any of that! I swear! Besides, it was all SFW. 

Dear Mum, 
I've grown close to the woman who runs the Coffee Nook. She doesn't talk much, and is very strict with little things sometimes. Actually kind of rude and a bit of a Karen before you get to know her. She reminds me of you, in a lot of ways. But that's a good thing, actually. I miss you, mum. 

Dear Mum, 
There's a little book club that meets at the Coffee Nook. It's only four people, so I feel a bit weird listening in on their conversations, but you know I can't really help myself. Apparently one of the members knows Casey, so she lets them get away with a lot more than other customers. She really doesn't like one of the people there, and I think she's got bad blood with one of the others. I have to disagree though, as far as I can tell everyone there is delightful!

Dear Mum, 
I may have accidentally joined the book club. They're reading through the Chronicles of Narnia right now, and I just couldn't resist joining in on the discussion. They were so friendly and welcoming, Dorothy especially. They're all a quite a bit older than I, it's a weird little collection. One of them was a little cold, Paul I think his name was. I don't know, he didn't seem to want to be there. 

Dear Mum, 
I got her name wrong in my last letter. Her name is Dorothea. Dorothea Hawthorne. That is so cool. I love you, but Gwendolyn Bridget Clooney wasn't your brightest moment. Anyway, the others, Heath and Evelyn are really nice too. I feel like I can talk to them about anything. Heath can be a bit intense though. Paul wasn't there today. 

Dear Mum, 
I met someone! Well, not met _met_, we're not dating or anything. It's the bassist of THE Goodbyes! I just ran into him at Pollock during my shift. They have gigs there quite often, and they're amazing live. He's really chill. The long-haired take it easy, down to earth type. Like a warm rock. That's also soft somehow. I think we're friends?

Dear Mum,
We're definitely friends! He's great. He's so sincere about everything he does. He opened up about the issues his band is experiencing. 

Dear Mum, 
I told Heath about my trip. He took it weird. I don't know. I tried to frame it more like a dream than a drug trip, because he didn't seem like the type to be accepting if you know what I mean. When I told him, he got real quiet. Later he whispered something to Dorothea and she stared at me. I don't know. I feel sick to my stomach. I hope they don't kick me out. 

Dear Mum,
I was wrong. I'll tell you once I can, I'll need to practice anyway. 

Dear Mum, 
I don't think I'd be able to talk to you like this if you were still around. I guess I'm not talking to my mother anymore, just the idea of her that lives in my head. I don't think I would have told the real you about partying to frivolously. 

Dear Mum, 
Turns out my whole trip was real in a way? I am witch now! Turns out book club is also also coven! And I am a full member, Dorotheas apprentice now, I think. I think Paul did not want me joining the coven. He seems protective of it. I think he is there just for the coven. Evelyn is not actually part of the coven either, so I have to be careful about what I say. Sorry about practicing my runes on you. I'll get better. 

Ugh what's with the similarity between I and T, it's just one little line. And C and K being identical is so confusing, especially for CH

Dear Mum, 
I got a job! Working at Pollock! It's a nightclub. Mr. Porter is nice. In a way. To be honest he's a bit slimy and I don't like him. 

Dear Mum, 
Sorry I've not been talking to you so much. I was very busy with uni and such. I actually ran into Paul at uni and talked to him a bit. He's known as Dr. Aracelsus there, which is just hilarious. I don't think he's as mean as I thought. He's just very focused. Weirdly perceptive, too. His memory is great, I don't even remember telling him I'm working at pollock now. He has these random moments where his eyes go wide and he absolutely needs a pen and paper, else he "might forget". He gets really upset when he doesn't find one in time. Only time I heard him swear. 

Dear Mum,
I'm hanging out a lot with Vince. He's quite into fantasy, so I asked the others if I can invite him to the book club. They said yes! He told me Vincent is his middle name. His first name is "Laurence". I think it's a 

Dear Mum, 
Paul hasn't been coming to meetings lately. The others are starting to get worried. He usually misses a lot of meeting but not this many. I've also not run into him at uni. 

Dear Mum, 
I asked around about Paul at uni. Nothing. He's been missing for a couple of weeks now. He's sending emails, apparently, but they can't get ahold of him. It sounds like something is actually wrong. We are going to try to scry where he is. Dorothea has a spell for that. I should start a spell book, I think my runic is good enough now. In other news, Ramona started a D&D game! I invited Vince to join, it's gonna be so fun!

Dear Mum, 
Scrying did not reveal anything. Nada. Zilch. According to Ms Hawthorne that means he is either snapped out of existence somehow, or in Faerie. She has volunteered to go, as the most experienced witch among us. It might be a while before she is back. The thinning, the place where you can step into faerie, is actually the place that Heath protected his campaign a few years ago. Time passes differently in Faerie, so it is best not to worry about it. 

Dear Mum, 
Vince left the D&D game. He said with Mickey's disappearance he has too much to worry about right now. I understand. It's weird. Two people disappearing so shortly after each other, I'm starting to get worried. 

Dear Mum, 
Lucy (Martin, not Billow) from Uni joined Ramona's D&D game for one session. That was really fun. She's quirky, I like that. Energetic. She uses odd language sometimes. But then again, so do I. I like her. I heard from Casey that she's actually going start working at the Cafe soon! That's so exciting!

Dear Mum, 
Something's happened to Casey. I don't know what, but I'm gonna find out.
