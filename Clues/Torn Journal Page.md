To my future self,  
I don't know how much I can say without causing a paradox or SOMETHING. I think we have a power. It's TIME TRAVEL. But I think we can only do it ONCE? So maybe *don't* use it? I don't know. I'm out of ideas and stuck in 1999, so my only chance is to try to reach my YOUNGER self in the future and try to stop myself from getting into this mess in the first place. Still, I guess this is my new life now. I found a job, and an apartment, that was hell. It's a lot more bigoted around ~~here~~ now. 

I went to Taranis out of habit today. He wasn't there, of course. It looks different. The building is newer. I talked to some of the people there. They're nice-ish. I might join. I don't know how, but one of the girls seemed really familiar. I didn't get a chance to talk to her much though, and I didn't catch her name. 

I joined the association. It feels weird, and not only because I'm deadnamed and they have the wrong sex. I never joined them in the future. My past. Whatever. This all still feels like a dream. 

Apparently, before I joined, there was a whole thing. One of the members had an accident and is now still in the hospital, another died only a few weeks later in a huge car crash with her whole family, and a third disappeared. Except the dad, I think. So the mood is not great. Still, everyone else is very nice. I might as well try to make lemonade. TIME lemonade. 

I talked to Harriet, and she spilled some tea. Apparently, the girl who's in the hospital, Analise, was in a relationship with Dana. They had been fighting about whether to go public about it, because GAY, but everyone knew already. And thankfully nobody minded. They're all okay with me as well, so I expected that. Dana left the association recently though. I get it, everything here reminds her of Analise.
