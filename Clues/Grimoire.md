### Spell - Audience With A Faerie
*Written in runic cypher*
**Equipment**: A Fire. A Twig Of Oak, Ash, And Thorn, Each. Twine Of Stag Hair. Six Candles Of Beeswax Which Have Already Burned For An Hour. Chalk Or Something Else To Write With.

**Preparation**: Build The Fire. Wrap The Twigs In The Stag Hair. Inscribe A Circle And Place Five Of The Candles Equidistant Upon It, With The Sixth In The Centre.

**The Spell**: Set Alight The Sticks And Twine In The Fire, Then Douse The Fire. Light The Candles Upon The Circle With The Lit Sticks, Waiting Exactly Three Seconds Between Each Candle. Then, Kneeling, Say The Name Of The Fairy You Wish To Call. Douse Each Candle In Turn, Clockwise, And Say Their Epitaphs. Begin With The Most Gracious, End On The Most Pressing To Your Matter.

If The Spell Has Been Performed Correctly, And The Faerie Will Take An Audience, There Will Smoke Drifting Into The Centre Candle. Pass The Lit Sticks Over The Smoke, Lighting The Candle. Have Your Audience With The Fae.

Be Certain To End The Spell When Your Audience Is Done. Douse The Sticks In Water And Blow Out The Centre Candle. Do Not Use It Again, Though You May Melt It Down And Reuse The Wax Itself.
