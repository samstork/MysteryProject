**Student athlete to compete at national level**

12 March 2024
Rebecca Quill

Tomorrow, students from all over the country will travel to Amsterdam to stab each other with swords. A hazing ritual gone wrong? No – it is the national fencing tournament! And joining is Groningen’s very own student fencing association, Taranis Fencing. So I set out to interview Anthony Stinger, a student in Groningen and rising star in the fencing community, to take a peek into the world of fencing.

**So, are you excited for the big day tomorrow?**

Very much so! And a bit nervous, of course – this is my first time competing in a tournament at this scale… It took a lot of hard work to get here. 

**Fencing, that is a rather unusual sport, no? How did you get into fencing?**

That is a funny story actually! I’ve always been a sporty kid, but I didn’t get into fencing until quite late. During my Bachelor’s, did a semester abroad in Spain. It is weird when you move to a new place in the middle of your studies, you know? Everyone else already has their lives established. So I was thinking of ways to meet new people, get involved in the student life there – and ended up trying out fencing! I pretty much immediately fell in love with this sport, and when I came back to Groningen, I joined Tanaris Fencing.

**… sounds like a match made in heaven! What is it that you love so much about fencing?**

Fencing is a variable sport – strength and athleticism are important, sure, but so is being agile. You need to always think on your feet to try and anticipate your opponent’s movements. So in a way, it is a really expressive sport: it’s a bit like boxing, dancing and chess all in one. But also, the sport isn’t the only great thing! The people are awesome, too. Fencing isn’t a team sport, but we still have a great team spirit in the fencing club, and I’ve met some of my favourite people here!

**So has it all been “smooth sailing” in your fencing journey?**

No – not really… I have struggled a lot with my health. I'm actually not really sure what it is. I have a lot of allergies, or something like that, but it's very inconsistent. I get random flare ups sometimes, it's really unpredictable. 

That's made it a bit difficult in the past, attending regular training sessions and so on… I feel like I've done a new allergen test every other week, and none of them have turned up anything conclusive. The docs say something about how the tests are never perfect, there's always false positive and negative rates and such, but with how many I've taken, that should even out. Turns out, I am a “statistical anomaly”, which is a lot more amusing for the people doing the tests than it is for me...

**That sounds really difficult. But as a student athlete, you're also facing plenty of other life challenges. You are balancing this competitive sport with a degree in computer science, right?. How is that going?**

Yes, I am. And, yeah, it is a bit of a balancing act – but it is working well so far! My professors have thankfully all been really understanding and supportive, and Allie, a friend of mine, shares his lecture notes with me, so I can catch up on anything I have missed. Actually, with computer science, you spend so much time just staring at screens. It's actually really nice to have something more physical to do.

**And when you are not studying or fencing, what do you like to do? Is there any time left?**

Hm, I like a bunch of things – hanging out with friends, playing games, that sort of thing! I am in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign run by a friend of mine, that's a lot of fun. I also enjoy going to concerts – The Goodbyes are really good. Their former bassist is also a friend of mine, actually, so I got them live a few times, which was really cool. They're very good live.

**Well, that’s all we have time for now – I’ll let you get back to preparing for tomorrow. Best of luck, and have fun in Amsterdam!**

Note from the editor (added 14 September): Due to sudden illness, Anthony Stinger had to withdraw from the tournament.
