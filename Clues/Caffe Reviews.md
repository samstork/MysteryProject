**_Groningen Coziness_**

With the warm autumn afternoons fading and the days getting colder and shorter, it is time to explore Groningen for the best spots to spend a rainy afternoon. So – raincoats and umbrellas at the ready, dear reader: these are the top five cozy places to be in the coming winter months!

**The Good Fire.** This former fire station turned pub is run by the charming, if somewhat eccentric, couple Mr. and Mrs. Watson. Decorated with innumerable old clocks, which all run badly and invariably show different times, The Good Fire had a truly “timeless” feel. So while you are here ignoring your deadlines, why not try something from their menu – English water, or English salad, or (if you are feeling a head cold coming on) Marietta’s pot brownies?

**Cobweb’s honey-bag.** Especially popular for its colorful staff uniforms and live music evenings, Cobweb’s honey-bag is perfect for those in the mood to party! They also offer a range of esoteric cocktails: don’t miss out on the “Red-hipped bumble bee”, a crowd favorite.

**Asterion’s lair.** Tucked into the outskirts of the town, getting to Asterion’s lair is a labyrinthine journey – but well worth it! Decorated with moss and plants and always well heated, this café provides the winter-weary customer with a little oasis of summer. What makes it unique though is not just its warm and cozy vibes or friendly owner, but the fact that it boasts a unique specialization in root vegetables. And if you think that this sounds unappealing, well – that just shows that you’ve never had the specialty of Asterion’s lair: the incomparable Parsnip Pie!

**[[The Coffee Nook]].** Between the quiet atmosphere in The Golden Rule and the walls covered in book shelves, this cozy café could almost be mistaken for a library. Casey Raid, the café’s owner, clearly knows a thing or two about literature – and her meticulously decorated and stocked book-café never fails to attract bibliophiles, such as local darling [[Heath M. Laffee|Heath Laffee]], who has been seen frequenting the location. So, if you want to explore new reading material, just you want some peace and quiet, or perhaps even plan to start a book club: [[The Coffee Nook]] is perfect for you.

Finally, if you get caught by a sudden downpour in the city center, why not find shelter in **The Very Nice Seagull**? On Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, this food stand can be found at the Vismarkt, with a tent for its customers. This small stand provides the best fries in Groningen – certified by the seagulls frequently gathering around this place. But June Kurashiki,  who runs the stand, assures us: at least they are not moderately aggressive swans!
