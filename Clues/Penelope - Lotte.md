L: Do you need anything else?
P: No I think I'm good for now :)
L: Are you really going through with it?
P: Yeah. I've committed, there's no turning back now. 
L: How long do you think you're going to have to stay hidden? The other's are starting to get worried about you.
P: I don't know. However long it takes for me to shake her off. Or for her to forget about me.
L: I'm not sure that's going to happen.
P: Well, so be it. I'm calling it tomorrow. I've got all I need. You were so much help, thank you. I never could have done this without you

L: Hey I've been meaning to ask, that thing about touches
P: Yeah, what about it?
L: I think my dad might have one.
P: Your dad? Why? What does he do?
L: I think he's too lucky.
P: Okay...
L: Really! He always wins at Yahtzee and coin tosses, and that sort of thing.
P: What, do coins always land on heads for him? XD
L: Nothing like that, but whenever it matters, it always goes his way. 
L: I'm going to encourage him to buy a lottery ticket. 
P: I think that's a bad idea
P: Touches are dangerous business. You know that. 
L: I don't know. They're just fairy gifts, right? Didn't the book say they can just be helpful?
P: I don't know...
