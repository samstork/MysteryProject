	- L: "I haven't had the chance yet, no :/"
	- L: "Sounds like I should though, if that's what you have to say about them"
	- C: "Oh yeah absolutely. I want to go again anyways."
	- L: "That sick huh?"
	- C: "Yeah, there's just something in the air when they play live. In the studio all that magic is totally GONE, idk why. It just hits different"
	- L: "I've felt that. Live music has something. It's dope."
	- C: "I still think you don't quite get it. You had to have been there"

	- C: "CORRECT!"
	- L: "And you're asking if I'd like to play?"
	- C: "And if you want to you could join"
	- C: "YEA!"
	- L: "I'm not sure... I am starting that new job in two weeks"
	- C: "Oh right"
	- C: "You could join for just one session, just to see if you like it?"
	- L: "I can probably do that :)"
- After the session 
	- C: "And, did you have fun?"
	- L: "I really liked it! I loved everyone's characters! Gwen's was hilarious. But I was really expecting more math based on what you decided to tell me"
	- C: "And she's playing the most boring ancestry/class combo... She's pretty good. And woops, yeah, I can get a bit crunchy sometimes"
	- C: "But at the end of the day it's all about getting to pretend your a cute catgirl with magic powers"

	- C: "So are you going to continue? RAmona said the seat is yours if you want it"
	- L: "I really liked it, it was a lot of fun, but I don't think I can commit to something this long term. I have my job *now*, but I don't know where I'll be a couple of weeks"
	- L: "I'm sorry"
	- C: "It's okay, I get it"
	- L: "I'd love to join for another session some time if you'll have me"
	- C: "We can DEFINITELY make that work!!"
