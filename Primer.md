This is what we have got so far. Mostly brainstormed by #Alissa, #Rachelle, #Sam,  and #Jana on 2025-03-09. 

During the party, Cass will be presented with a mystery to solve in a style similar to games like *The Outer Wilds* and *The Return of the Obra Dinn*. This mystery involves a variety of characters and some fantastical aspects. She will talk to characters, examine clues, and solve puzzles. 

## Story
### Overview
The main points are as follows:
- Faeries and other such fantastical creatures are real
- Certain people have been touched by the fae, giving them minor magical powers (a "[[Touch]]"). Often they are not aware of what their boon is. 
- A mysterious figure known as the [[Trapper]] (name WIP) has been going around and tricking these people into giving up their souls, which are kept in [[Lockets]]
- Lockets are actual props some people have
	- Someone wearing a [[Lockets|Locket]] does not know they are wearing it, or if they do, they don't think anything of it. 
	- The person in the locket can take over the wearer's body upon prompting 
		- We don't know how yet, but most likely by a specific phrase or by someone touching the [[Lockets|locket]]
		- (This was originally so we can play characters which aren't us but now have to remain in character the entire time)
		- [[Lockets]] only work for specific people. 
	- People trapped in a locket have memory issues
		- They don't remember how they got there
		- Their memory resets when they cease controlling a body
		- Their episodic memory is a little broken up. They need to be reminded of things with phrases, at which point they'll remember things
		- They do not recognise each other and can't recognise photos of themselves
- [[Trapper]] was collecting these to give themselves more [[Touch|fae touches]]. 
	- We still have to come up with a grand reason for why they want it. Just "I wanna be more powerful" is a bit boring
	- Secret identity of someone else involved in the mystery 
	- Maybe it's their unique power to trap people like that

### Characters
- Characters will all be placed in a Character Web. No character has 0 relation to any other character, they're all connected somehow. 
- We're planning for somewhere around 5 or 6 "cast" characters, which can be played by some of us at the party. These would be primarily characters stuck in lockets which Cass can interact with by activating them, see above.
- Additionally there would be "Lore" characters which are not played by people at the party, but can be learned about from evidence, clues, and cast characters. 
- We, as real people can also have information to some extent
- We're planning on having a number of groups/factions which people belong to
	- For example, a crime syndicate, a book club, or a band
	- There could also be some cross-faction conflict
	- Or characters belonging to multiple
	- Also allows for drama within the group
- We have some specific character ideas 
	- **[[Trapper]]**
		- Currently, [[Trapper]] is just going to be a lore character 
		- They should be a regular character. The reveal that they're trapper would therefore be a big deal
	- A character that travelled back in time (it was their power to go back in time once)
	- A Journalist who writes about fae-touched people
		- Not a locket, but is the last person to be targeted by the trapper

## Gameplay Ideas
This section is about ideas we have for how to actually implement the game. The things Cass can do while playing. 
- She can talk to Locket bound characters
- Cypher
	- Book cypher
	- Alternate alphabet with rules we come up with
	- Different language?
- Outer Wilds mod
	- I can pretty easily implement a mod in the Outer Wilds we can put hidden messages and 3d model props the
- Picture of a place she needs to find (BotW memory style). Something is then hidden there
- Inspect "Evidence"
	- Newspaper clippings
		- Local articles
		- Obituaries
		- Marriage announcements 
		- etc.
	- a diary
	- Local brochure
		- Tourist info
		- political
