This is what we have got so far. Mostly brainstormed by #Alissa, #Rachelle, #Sam,  and #Jana on 2025-03-09. 

During the party, Cass will be presented with a mystery to solve in a style similar to games like *The Outer Wilds* and *The Return of the Obra Dinn*. This mystery involves a variety of characters and some fantastical aspects. She will talk to characters, examine clues, and solve puzzles. 

## Story
### Overview
The main points are as follows:
- Faeries and other such fantastical creatures are real
- Certain people have been touched by the fae, giving them minor magical powers (a "[[Touch]]"). Often they are not aware of what their boon is. 
- [[Penelope Mayer]] has been going around and tricking these people into giving up their souls, which are kept in [[Lockets]]
- Lockets are actual props some people have
	- Someone wearing a [[Lockets|Locket]] does not know they are wearing it, or if they do, they don't think anything of it. 
	- The person in the locket can take over the wearer's body upon prompting 
		- We don't know how yet, but most likely by a specific phrase or by someone touching the [[Lockets|locket]]
		- (This was originally so we can play characters which aren't us but now have to remain in character the entire time)
		- [[Lockets]] only work for specific people. 
	- People trapped in a locket have memory issues
		- They don't remember how they got there
		- Their memory resets when they cease controlling a body
		- Their episodic memory is a little broken up. They need to be reminded of things with phrases, at which point they'll remember things
		- They do not recognise each other and can't recognise photos of themselves
- [[Penelope Mayer]] was collecting these to give themselves more [[Touch|fae touches]]. 

### Characters


## Gameplay Ideas
The main gameplay will involve poring over clues, evidence, and dialogue with cast members, leading to deductions. 
#### Goal
The main goal of the game is to 
- Find out what's happening, who the [[Penelope Mayer]] is, why they're doing it, etc. 
	- Still need to workshop the specifics of this. Probably easier once we have some characters and a timeline.
- Assign a name, and [[Touch]] to each [[Lockets|locket]]

#### Clue formats
These are some ideas we had as to what the clues she receives actually look like:
- Dialogue with [[Lockets|Locket]] cast characters
	- She may need specific information to talk to someone about a given topic, asking them the correct things
	- Not all [[Lockets]] would be available from the start, 
- Diary
- Newspaper clippings
	- Local articles
	- Obituaries
	- Marriage announcements 
	- etc.
- Local brochure
	- Tourist info
	- political
- Audio recording on Cassettes, since she has a cassette player
- Printouts of (digital) conversations
	- printout of a forum discussion
	- Text messages
	- Emails
	- Interviews, police or journalism
- Burner phone contents
#### Minigames
- Picture of a place, she then needs to find where it was taken (BotW memory style), and something is then hidden there
-  Decode Cyphered messages
	- Book cypher
	- Alternate alphabet with rules we come up with
	- Different language?
- Outer Wilds mod
- I can pretty easily implement a mod in the Outer Wilds we can put hidden messages and 3d model props the game.
